# BASM Sdk Community

BASM Sdk Community is a Rust crate that aids in the development of programs written for the Blocky Attestation Service.

It is currently under development, everything is subject to change. If you have any suggestions please contact me at `matthew@jurenka.software`

This workspace is structured into three crates, `basm-sdk-community` contains the main library, `basm-sdk-community-macros` is a proc-macro crate that contains the entrypoint attribute macro, and `integration-test` is a integration test / example directory for testing everything.

More information about how to use the SDK can be found in `basm-sdk-community/README.md`
